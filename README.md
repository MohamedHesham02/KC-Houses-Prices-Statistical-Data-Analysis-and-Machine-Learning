# KC-Houses-Prices-Statistical-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning


This project is done using kc Houses parameters and prices dataset used to make statistical data analysis to clean the data, summarize their main characteristics of parameters, description of parameters like mean, median, mode variance and standard deviation,Â  mining of growth, plots and mapping of relations between parameters 
Then, machine learning prices prediction is done by Scikit-Learn and using various neural networks to compare accuracies, root mean square errors between them and the best accuracy resulted from Scikit-Learn methods is 73% and its predicted, that will be higher with keras neural networks.
